# Release v0.92.0

## Summary
- Auto-populate `strategy_stock_mapping` from backtest results; add history name fallback and tests

## Changes
- Call `StrategyStockMappingService.updateMapping(...)` after persisting backtest results to auto-populate mapping used by selection and reporting.
- Add fallback name resolution in `HistoryDataService` to recover missing stock names from historical bar data.
- Replace heavyweight Spring integration test with focused Mockito-style tests and add unit tests to improve CI determinism.
- Minor test and documentation improvements to increase reliability and developer workflow clarity.
