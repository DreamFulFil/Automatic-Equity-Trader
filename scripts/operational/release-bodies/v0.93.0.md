# Release v0.93.0

## Summary
- Add operational helpers and checks; canonicalize bump helper

## Changes
- Add `scripts/operational/create-release.sh` and canonical `scripts/operational/bump-version.sh` to standardize the release workflow.
- Add operational checks: `check_shioaji_config.py` and `check_yahoo_rate_limits.py` with pytest coverage and deterministic fixtures.
- Update prompts to centralize logs under `logs/` using timestamped filenames (LOG_TS) and add operational docs describing checks and usage.
- Improve CI determinism by adding deterministic fixtures and moving heavy checks into opt-in operational scripts.
