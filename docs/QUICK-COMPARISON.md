# ⚡ Capped vs. Unlimited Strategy Comparison

## 🔴 OLD Approach (Profit Caps)

### Exit Rules:
- ✅ Stop-loss: -10 points (-500 TWD)
- ✅ **Take profit: +20 points (+1,000 TWD)** ← Caps upside!
- ✅ Daily target: 1,000 TWD → stop trading
- ✅ Monthly cap: 30,000 TWD → stop trading

### Example Month:
```
Week 1: +6,000 TWD (4 wins × 1,000 + 2 losses × 500)
Week 2: +5,500 TWD (stopped early - hit daily cap)
Week 3: +7,000 TWD 
Week 4: +8,000 TWD
→ Hit 30,000 cap mid-week 4, STOPPED TRADING
Final: 30,000 TWD (left 10,000+ on table)
```

**Problem**: Strong trending weeks get cut short!

## 🟢 NEW Approach (NO Caps)

### Exit Rules:
- ✅ Stop-loss: -10 points (-500 TWD)
- ✅ **Exit on trend reversal only** ← Let winners run!
- ✅ NO daily profit cap
- ✅ NO monthly profit cap

### Same Example Month:
```
Week 1: +9,000 TWD (2 runners × 3,000 + 3 small × 1,000)
Week 2: +12,000 TWD (1 BIG runner × 7,000 + 5 × 1,000)
Week 3: +8,000 TWD (consolidation, smaller moves)
Week 4: +18,000 TWD (trending week, 3 runners)
→ NO CAPS, kept trading all month
Final: 47,000 TWD (+57% gain!)
```

**Result**: Captured full trending moves!

## 📊 Real Trade Example

### Trade: LONG MTXF @ 17850

#### OLD Approach (Capped):
```
11:35 → Entry @ 17850
11:42 → Up 15 points (+750 TWD)
11:47 → Up 20 points (+1,000 TWD)
        ❌ TAKE PROFIT (hit target)
        EXIT @ 17870

Final: +1,000 TWD
```

But price kept going...
```
12:15 → Would be at 17920 (+70 points, +3,500 TWD)
12:45 → Would be at 17980 (+130 points, +6,500 TWD)
```

**Opportunity Cost**: 5,500 TWD left on table! 😢

#### NEW Approach (Unlimited):
```
11:35 → Entry @ 17850
11:42 → Up 15 points → HOLD (trend strong)
11:47 → Up 20 points → HOLD (momentum accelerating)
12:15 → Up 70 points → HOLD (still trending)
12:40 → Up 125 points
12:42 → Momentum flip detected!
        ✅ EXIT ON REVERSAL
        EXIT @ 17975

Final: +6,250 TWD (+125 points)
```

**Difference**: 6,250 vs. 1,000 = **+525% on this trade!** 🚀

## 🔥 Why Remove Caps?

### 1. Asymmetric Risk/Reward
- Capped: Risk 10 to make 20 (2:1)
- Unlimited: Risk 10 to make 50-100+ (5:1 to 10:1+)

### 2. Market Edge Utilization
- Strong trends = best edge
- Caps force you to exit when edge is strongest!

### 3. Psychological Freedom
- No more "should I close?" anxiety
- Let the market decide (reversal signal)

### 4. Compounding Power
- Big wins power account growth
- One 6,000 TWD win = 6× small wins

## ⚠️ Risk Controls (Still 100% Enforced!)

✅ **What DIDN'T change**:
- Max position: 1 contract
- Stop-loss: -500 TWD per trade
- Daily loss limit: -4,500 TWD
- Trading window: 11:30-13:00
